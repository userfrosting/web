title: Why should I use this? The other options seem easier.

It may seem simpler to integrate one of the thousands of PHP login scripts that show up in a Google search - and perhaps it would be, at first!  But over time, a purely procedural approach tends to leave you with a [big ball of mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud) - a project that is poorly structured and nearly impossible to maintain.  


Furthermore, many of these "user scripts" tend to lack proper maintenance and long-term community support.  Bugs and other issues in their codebase can easily end up being _your_ problem, and you may end up needing to significantly rewrite these scripts when major design and security issues come up.


UserFrosting does take a little more work to set up and learn at first, but it's worth it and we're [here](https://chat.userfrosting.com) to [help](https://github.com/orgs/userfrosting/discussions).  The concepts and design principles you'll learn as you write (or rewrite) your project with UserFrosting go far beyond this framework, and even PHP itself!  You'll come out a stronger software developer with a more robust application - how many other login scripts can say that?
