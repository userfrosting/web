## No need to reinvent the wheel - everything you need for a user-centered application has already been implemented!

### Fully functional sign-in system
Works out of the box.

### Administrative user management
A built-in user management page lets you view, search, and sort your users, create new user accounts, and edit existing ones.  Also provides tools to disable or delete users, manage permissions, and issue password resets.

### Roles and permissions
Powerful role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to define fine-grained, programmatic rules for user access, then manage those permissions through the role management page.

### User dashboards
Build beautiful dashboards for your users with the default AdminLTE theme.

### Password reset for new users
Self-service password reset tools - for when the inevitable happens!

### Public registration (optional)
Optionally, open your site for public account registration.  Captcha and email verification can be enabled to cut down on spammy accounts.

### Account profile
Let users modify various properties of their account - or not!  Everything you need is already in place.

### Root account
The root account lets you, the developer, bypass access control during testing.

### User activity logging
Log user activities and IP addresses to the database or another service of your choice, then view them through the admin interface.

### User groups
Assign users to groups and customize their experience of your site.
