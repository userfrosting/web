        A framework and an application.
    </h3>
    <p class="flow-text">
        UserFrosting is a web framework for PHP.  Like other web frameworks, it offers a complete toolbox of programmatic components for building your application.
    </p>
    <p class="flow-text">
        Unlike other PHP frameworks, <em> it's a fully-functioning user management application,</em> right out of the box.  And, it's fully extendable so that you can easily create the custom features you need.

        UserFrosting is designed to bring new and returning developers up to speed with the modern PHP community.  You'll be comfortably introduced to Composer (the dependency manager), object-oriented design patterns, and the PHP Standards Recommendations (PSR), making your code better structured and easier to manage.

        What's more, you'll learn how to use Node.js and Bower to cleanly manage client-side packages (Javascript and CSS).  Transform yourself from a code monkey into a software engineer.
